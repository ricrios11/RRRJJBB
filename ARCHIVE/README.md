# 🗂️ DEPRECATED FILES ARCHIVE

## Purpose
This directory contains all deprecated build attempts and redundant files to clean up the main workspace while preserving history.

## Archived Directories
- `test-09` through `test-34` - Various build attempts
- `production-build-v3` through `v6` - Version iterations
- `EXPERT-PRODUCTION-BUILD` - Superseded by CANONICAL-BUILD
- `FINAL-PRODUCTION` - Merged into canonical source
- `FINAL-CORRECTED-PRODUCTION` - Legacy version

## Clean Workspace Strategy
Main workspace now contains only:
- `CANONICAL-BUILD/` - Single source of truth
- `components/` - Component library
- Core configuration files

## Archive Date
Created: 2024 - Technical Debt Cleanup Initiative

**DO NOT REFERENCE THESE FILES** - Use `CANONICAL-BUILD/` as the authoritative source.
