```

## 🚀 Deployment

**Production Ready**: Single-file deployment with zero dependencies

**Local Development**:

1. Clone repository
2. Serve `cyberpunk-portfolio.html` (no build process required)
3. Experience ASCII brutalism and interactive gaming layer

## 🎯 Technical Excellence

### Archive & Legacy Systems

- `ARCHIVE/2025-02-unused/` contains the experimental React prototype (`src/`), AgentX labs, build scripts/config, and validation tooling.
- Historical documentation, heuristics, and superseded builds now live alongside those assets to keep the working tree lean.
- When you need to revive any of those systems, copy them out of the archive into a feature branch—nothing in the active build references them anymore.

### Development Workflow
1. Modify `index.html`, `css/`, or the live `js/` modules.
2. Run `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:8000` for smoke tests.
3. Validate touch + keyboard flows on both modals/games.
4. Commit + deploy by publishing the updated static files.

### Future Roadmap
- [ ] Modular React component extraction
- [ ] TypeScript integration
- [ ] Automated testing suite
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Performance optimization

## 🧱 Current Debt & Next Moves
1. **Modal Normalization** – lazy-load the remaining hidden markup, add shared scroll-lock + exit animations, and wire the immersive overlays into the unified theme hooks.
2. **Micro-IA Pulse** – ship the Lab Log console + diagnostics copy so the system narrates what each mode is doing (Trojan signature).
3. **Mobile Deep Polish** – extend the new safe-area/touch grid rules beyond the games so case studies + manifesto breathe on <768px.
4. **Testing Harness** – add a lint + minimal regression script (even a windowed `npm run lint`) so future modular edits land safely.
5. **RR Arrival Ritual** – expand the fresh ASCII animation into the nav + diagnostics chips so time-of-day transitions feel scripted, not decorative.
